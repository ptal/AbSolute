# Scheduling Data Sets

`kobe` parses different file format describing scheduling problems such as RCPSP and its variants.
We give a list of the supported formats and data sets available in [kobe-rcpsp](https://github.com/ptal/kobe-rcpsp), and credit the owners of these data sets.
We have clean these data sets of all the meta-information that was uneccessary to us, but feel free to consult the references given for the full data set.

We formatted known optimum results in a CSV format that is common to every data set (e.g. `data/rcpsp/j30.sm/optimum/optimum.csv`).

## RCPSP

1. Patterson (.rcp): Format originally used to evaluate RCPSP in Patterson (1984).
   It is the format used by the RanGen1 and RanGen2 generators.
   Sets of instances:
    1. Patterson: 110 instances.
    2. RG300[1]: 480 instances, 300 activities, 4 resources.
    3. RG30[2]: 900, 180, 240, 240, 240 instances, 30 activities, 4 resources.
       Resource data a bit "restricted" (in the way it was generated) on the RG30 sets.
    4. MT[3]: 900, 800, 1200, 1200 instances, 30 activities, 0 resource.
       ResSet[4]: Can be merged with MT for resources specifications.

2. SM format (.sm):

  Format of the PSPLIB, a well-known library for RCPSP with sets of instances of 30, 60, 90 and 120 activities.
  Sets of instances:
    1. j30: 480 instances, 30 activities and 4 resources.
    2. j60: 480 instances, 60 activities and 4 resources.
    3. j90: 480 instances, 90 activities and 4 resources.
    4. j120: 600 instances, 120 activities and 4 resources.

## RCPSP/max

3. ProGenMax format (.SCH):

  Format of the sets of instances produced by the ProGenMax instance generator.
  It concerns the RCPSP/max problem.

  Sets of instances:
    1. C, D: each 540 instances, 100 activities, 5 resources.
    2. UBO_N: each 90 instances, N activities, 5 resources.
       N in 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000.
    3. J_N: 270 instances, N activities, 5 resources.
       N in 10, 20, 30.

## MMRCPSP (multi-mode RCPSP)

2. SM format (.sm): Similar to for RCPSP. With nonrenewable resources.

    Sets of instances:
      1. J_N: 3840 instances in total, N activities,
         N in 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 30

4. SM format light (.sm): Similar to SM format but without some headers.

    Sets of instances:
      1. MMLIB50: 540 instances, 50 activities, 3 modes.
      2. MMLIB100: 540 instances, 100 activities, 3 modes.
      3. MMLIB+: 3240 instances, 50 or 100 activities, 3, 6 or 9 modes.
